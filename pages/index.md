I am a Programmer and surfer who works for [Jack Russell Software](http://jackhq.com) in Charleston, SC.  We build pharmacy and healthcare applications in Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Coffeescript and NodeJS.  Personally, I am very fond of nodeJS and CoffeeScript.

I am very passionate about surfing and have 2 young daughters who like to surf
with me. I am still working on setting up their team site at [RootsSurf.com](http://rootssurf.com).

I also enjoy screen printing and playing piano with the Monkey Men as well as
composing and recording original classical compositions.  A sample of a
jazz tune I composed, recorded, and performed by myself can be found
[here](/jazz_sax.mp3).

I am Using [Bam](https://github.com/beautifulnode/bam) to generate this static site and serve with Apache on Media Temple.
